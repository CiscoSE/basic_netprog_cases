# Automating the Configuration of an Access Port

## Author: Russell Johnston

The scripts included in this section are to provide some introduction on how using some entry level python configurations can be automated and configured on a specific interface.

Two methods are demonstrated:
1. Using Netmiko to connect to an interface and configure an identified port.
2. Using Ansible to deliver the same configurations.

Both methods are used to aid in understanding some of the options available to network engineers. Depending on the required results one method may be more useful than the other.
